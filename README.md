This is my attempt to leverage M2-chip powered computer to execute Lucas-Lehmer Test on dicovering Mersenne primes - potentially perfect numbers of order 50 or higher.

So far 52 perfect numbers have been discovered as of: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mersenne_primes_and_perfect_numbers

highest is 388692...008576 with 82,048,640 digits.

PRP test is prepfered, and it needs to be verified by LLT
